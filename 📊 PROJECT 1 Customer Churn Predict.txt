üìä PROJECT 1: Customer Churn Prediction
üß† Objective
Predict which customers are likely to leave a service (telecom/OTT/SaaS/etc.) using historical customer data, so the company can retain them through targeted campaigns.

üè¢ Business Context
Telecom/Subscription companies lose significant revenue due to customer churn. Acquiring new customers is expensive, so retaining existing customers is more profitable. By predicting churn early, businesses can:

Offer personalized deals

Improve customer service

Prevent revenue loss

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works ‚Äì Full Workflow
Step 1: Data Collection
Use the Telco Customer Churn Dataset:

Columns: gender, SeniorCitizen, tenure, Contract, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Churn, etc.

Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Step 2: Data Cleaning
Convert TotalCharges to numeric and handle non-numeric rows

Replace missing values (NaN) with median/mean

Convert 'Yes/No' to binary (1/0)

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of churners vs non-churners

Identify churn patterns: Are month-to-month customers more likely to churn?

Visuals:

Bar plots (churn by contract type)

Heatmaps (correlation between variables)

Box plots (Monthly charges vs churn)

Step 4: Feature Engineering
Create new columns such as:

AvgMonthlySpend = TotalCharges / tenure

Is_Long_Term = tenure > 12

One-hot encode Contract, PaymentMethod, etc.

Step 5: Data Splitting
Split into X and y

70% for training, 30% for testing using train_test_split()

Step 6: Model Building
Train multiple models and compare:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Random Forest

XGBoost (high performance)

Step 7: Evaluation
Use:

Confusion Matrix (True Positive, False Negative)

Accuracy, Precision, Recall

F1-score

ROC-AUC Curve to visualize performance

Step 8: Interpretation
Use SHAP or feature importance to explain:

What features drive churn (e.g., short tenure, high monthly charges)

Step 9: Output
Predict churn probability for new customers

Generate a CSV file with CustomerID, Churn_Prob, Top_Reason

Optional: Build a Tableau dashboard for managers

üîß Tools & Technologies:
Python: Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, XGBoost

Power BI/Tableau: Churn dashboard (optional)

Jupyter/Colab for development

üßë‚Äçüíº Interview/Resume Explanation
‚ÄúI developed a churn prediction model using XGBoost on telco customer data. The model achieved 88% AUC, and key churn drivers included short tenure and monthly billing. I also created a dashboard showing high-risk segments for retention strategy.‚Äù

this is the documentary link where  we get all the details regarding the project and get the help needed, this mainly focuses on XGBoost algorithm and can get other algorithms from other sources like Kaggle . And here the author has used the dataset from Kaggle
